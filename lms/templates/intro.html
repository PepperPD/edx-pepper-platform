          Common Core State Standards (CCSS) will touch the lives of nearly every teacher and student. For the first time in our history, a 
clear and unified set of expectations will guide classroom instruction to ensure that all students are ready for college and careers. 
Educators everywhere are diligently preparing to implement these standards and aligned assessments by the beginning of the 2014-15 
school year, seeking the best possible resources to guide them in the process.

			PCG works closely with over 4,000 districts across the country listened and took note as educators articulated their Common Core needs. Teachers shared with us their excitement about a project-based, performance-oriented set of standards and accompanying assessments that encourage them to teach in new ways that active student thinking and intellectual engagement. They also expressed a need for guidance and assistance to effectively implement the Common Core.

			When PCG, WestEd and EDU2000 sat down to combine their perspectives, they envisioned resources to address common themes expressed by 
every educator: resources that can be accessed online 24/7; resources to help every teacher become a CCSS specialist; and resources 
that allow ALL teachers to reflect and track their learning and share Common Core thoughts with colleagues.

			As the backbone of these resources our team selected edX, a Harvard/MIT developed learning management system, to use as the delivery platform for the new program.
